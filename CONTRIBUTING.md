# Firstly, thanks!  

A quick letter from me to you:

```
Hi!

Thank you for wanting to contribute to LegacyFactions! It's people like you that
really let free open-source projects flourish and become something amazing.

Myself, other contributors, and users appreciate it so much.

I can't wait to see what we create together :-)

Lots of love,

Mark ("MarkehMe")

Feel free to email me about minecraft, jobs, ideas, or just to say hey! But don't report LegacyFactions issues to me directly (just report them here on GitHub)

# Contributing
There are many ways you can contribute:
* Reporting Issues
* Providing Ideas
* Creating a PR
* Giving Feedback

## Reporting Issues

Software always comes with issues! But there are 3 things you must provide for us to help you:

* Software Type and Versions (server type + version, and plugin version)
* Steps to reproduce
* Copies of your entire server log (pop it on pastebin)

People are likely to ask you more questions so always be ready for more questions! But most of all, be patient! We're all volunteering here.

## Providing Ideas

Ideas rule! Take it from Anna Quindlen; "Ideas are like pizza dough, made to be tossed around" ... so lets get tossing! Plus, I really like pizza. 

Open a new issue and provide a clear description of your idea. Be ready for feedback, love, and hate. Not everyone likes the same thing, and people may want to add onto your idea!

## Creating a PR

A Pull Request is a fantastic way to contribute. Please just follow a few things:
* Use our style guide. This makes it easy for everyone to read your code!
* Prepare for feedback and changes! We're not mean people, we just want to work together and avoid issues.
* 1 PR = 1 Feature. Please only make 1 feature or change per PR. We need a tidy commit log!

## Giving Feedback

We're always open to feedback from others, so please feel free to give feedback on PR. Just be nice! Don't be afraid to throw in a smiley emoji or something - everyone reads your text with a blank face. :)
